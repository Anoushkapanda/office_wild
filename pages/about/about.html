      content="L2MRail has developed an innovative Wheel Impact Load Detection (F-WILD) system in partnership with RDSO, Indian Railway, Government of India. Our F-WILD system captures the wheel signature as a train moves over the instrumented zone of the track and processes data in real-time. The processed information is stored in secured servers (private cloud) for all authorized persons to view through a customized GUI. Information on the critically damaged wheels is communicated through messages to designated authorities. Our solution enables the Railway companies to monitor the health of all rail wheels that pass over the ‘WILD-zone’ and assists in condition-based maintenance of rolling stock, thereby reducing the maintenance costs while improving the rolling stock life cycle."

        <h2>F-WILD (Wheel Impact Load Detector)</h2>
        <p><strong>The Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD)</strong> system measures the load exerted by a train's wheels on the rails and calculates the impact load of each wheel. When a wheel passes over the rail, it causes the rail to bend. <strong>Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)</strong> sensors integrated into the system detect this bending by monitoring changes in the reflected wavelength.

        <h2>Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensors</h2>
        <p>FBG sensors are optical sensors that utilize light reflection within optical fibers to detect changes in physical parameters such as strain, temperature, and pressure. These sensors have a periodic variation in the refractive index along the fiber core, which reflects a specific wavelength of light, called the <strong>Bragg wavelength</strong>, while allowing other wavelengths to pass. When external forces (strain or temperature changes) are applied, the spacing of the grating and the refractive index change, shifting the reflected wavelength.

        <h2>Key Features of F-WILD</h2>
       <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Comprehensive Wheel Monitoring:</strong> Tracks and collects data for each individual wheel of a train as it passes over sensor-equipped rails.</li>

          <li><strong>Data Processing and Classification:</strong> Processes data in real-time, classifying wheels based on measured impact load, and detecting defects or anomalies.</li>

          <li><strong>Accurate Load Measurement:</strong> FBG sensors provide precise measurements of the load and impact force exerted by each wheel.</li>

          <li><strong>Real-Time Condition Monitoring: </strong>Monitors wheel conditions in real-time, enabling prompt detection of issues such as wheel flats or high impact loads.</li>

          <li><strong>Scalable and Flexible Deployment:</strong> Can be deployed across multiple rail sections and easily integrated into existing rail infrastructure.</li>

          <li><strong>Automatic Alerts:</strong> Sends automatic alerts to railway depots whenever a defect such as high impact loads is detected, allowing for quick maintenance action.</li>
